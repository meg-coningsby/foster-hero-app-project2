## 📖 App Overview

A management app for animal rescue groups (more specifically cats, but it could be customised for any animals) that manage foster carers, animals, vets and vet appointments.

The core features of the app:

-   View all animals that are available for adoption (just as an overview - you can't click in to any animal details).
-   Log in to view the details behind the rescue animals, foster carers, vets and vet appts.
-   Add, edit or remove animals, and then allocate them a foster carer.
-   Add notes or vet appointments to a specific animal.
-   View all foster carers and the animals that are in, and have previously been, in their care.
-   View all rescue approved vets, and the appointments at those vets.
