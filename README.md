## 📖 App Overview

A management app for animal rescue groups (more specifically cats, but it could be customised for any animals) that manage foster carers, animals, vets and vet appointments.

The core features of the app:

-   View all animals that are available for adoption (just as an overview - you can't click in to any animal details).
-   Log in to view the details behind the rescue animals, foster carers, vets and vet appts.
-   Add, edit or remove animals.
-   Add notes or vet appointments to a specific animal.
-   View all foster carers and then what animals are currently under their care.
-   View all rescue approved vets, and the appointments at those vets.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Head over to the app [here](https://foster-hero-app.onrender.com/).

1. Log in

You will need to log in to see most of the pages on the app. Unauthenticated users can only see a list of cats that are currently up for adoption - no other pages. Logging in does create a user profile for you - which is added to the app's Foster Carers (as in the real world, all that log in would be members of the rescue group).

2. Browse the app. You will notice that some things are not editable by your user - you can only:

-   Edit or delete your own Foster Carer profile.
-   Edit or remove any cats you created (all other cats are uneditable by your user).
-   Add a vet appointment for a cat you created.
-   Add or delete notes to a cat. You can only delete a note you created.

Please note, all the data already included in the app is just for demo purposes. No real data was used (although all the cats linked to the Foster Carer 'Meg C' were all my foster cats at one point - their data has been made up, but their photos and names are real! All have been adopted and are now in new homes.)
